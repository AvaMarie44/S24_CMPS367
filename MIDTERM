#midterm  Bank account management system 


#purpose of the app 
creating a simple bank account system using classes 
it should include 
1. create a new bank account with an initial balance 
2. deposit money into an account 
3. withdraw money from an account 
4. display the current balance of an account 

#execution 
I included the libraries, <iostream>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>, <string> 
Within the main BankAccount Class, which has three private variables: 'name', 'accountNumber', and 'balance' 
As well 'deposit()' and 'withdraw()' allow depositing and withdrawing money from the account 
I put in an array of BankAccounts where the bank accounts are stored 'numAccounts' is where the code keeps track of the number of accounts
currently stored in the array 
Within the display, the main menu gives the output and the options for banking operations 
The void creatNewAccount has a cin for the user name and initial balance 
Then  at the end of the code, it performs the if statements with the transaction and deposit/withdrew options.
